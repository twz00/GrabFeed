Problem statement: Feeding the less fortunate while reducing food waste generated by the F&B industry.

Everyday there are large amount of food waste generated by businesses in the form of unsold food. Instead of disposing these perfectly consumable food, we can put these food into the hands of people who are struggling to feed themselves.
Using the existing grab services, an additional service named "Grabfeed" can be introduced with the objective of tackling the problem statement. Grabfeed allows businesses to put the unsold food up for order similar to the usual Grabfood service. Users who are able to provide proof of low income will be allowed access to the Grabfeed service in Grabfood. Orders under Grabfeed will only include a delivery fee and the food items are all free of charge. 
This way businesses have a better way to deal with the unsold food other than just disposing it, benefiting the underprivilege.
